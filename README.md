# CSI293---Capstone-Project
 
# Melody Rider

Melody Rider is a rhythm-based web game developed using Unity and .NET Core. This capstone project was more to demonstrate an understanding of my skills learned at RTC than to showcase a finished product. As such, there are currently no plans to finish this project.
